# The report
The report for the exam, thus, consists of the answer to all the following prompts:
- Describe your machine learning pipeline. Produce a diagram of it to guide the reader (e.g. see Rybner et al 2022 Vocal markers of autism: Assessing the generalizability of ML models), and describe the different parts: data budgeting, data preprocessing, model choice and training, assessment of performance.

- Briefly justify and describe your use of simulated data, and results from the pipeline on them.

- Describe results from applying the ML pipeline to the empirical data and what can we learn from them.

Remember: plots are very very important to communicate your process and results.
